What is that ?

This file is a simple tool I made to get a specific portion of an image. It can return, in <input> entities,
the offset of the pixel from which you cut, taking the top left corner as the origin. It also returns the 
width and the height of the image you want to get as a result. Simply pass those as hidden <input> fields.
The user can't take an image that would get out of the box. Specifying a new size for the mover does not 
break the collision checks with the borders of the parent element. However, i strongly advice you to 
doublecheck you're not going to draw something empty with GD, this time in the PHP script.
Then you could use the sample php script I made.

PHP SCRIPT FORMAT
file.php?params=100,20,50,50,IMAGEURL
The point of coordinates (100, 20) will be used as the beginning to the cropping in the file which URL is IMAGEURL. 
The script returns as an image as willed, except if errors are thrown. That's very basic and insecure, I'm counting
on you to enhance it.
